The `s` and `r` query parameters make up an ECDSA signature.
The server validates this signature before giving you access to a file.

I'm pretty bad a cryptography, so I forgot to change the nonce for each signature I generated.
Unfortunately this implementation of ecdsa is pretty vulnerable to nonce reuse.

If you can figure out what the reused nonce is, you can figure out what my secret key is. Doh!
You should definitely check out how the signatures are generated in ecdsa.py
